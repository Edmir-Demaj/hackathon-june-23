We aim to empower individuals by providing tools, resources, and guidance that promote self-care, personal growth, and resilience. Our goal is to nurture a community where mental, emotional, and physical well-being are prioritized, leading to a stronger and more vibrant community overall.

## User Experience (UX)

A group of unlikely coders with various abilities came together to produce a website dedicated to representing the LGBTQ+ community and bring awareness to others about the struggles encountered by the community throughout history and up to the current day.
The concept of the name Spectrumind developed from the idea of connecting mental wellness and the human brain and associating the light spectrum to a community defined by its rainbow colors.
Key information for the site

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The color palette comprising FF5252 (red), E1BEE7 (pink), 114069 (navy blue), C2DFE8 (light blue), and BC5BBC (purple) was selected for the project "SpectrumInd" to represent LGBTQ pride for several reasons. Firstly, the color red (FF5252) is often associated with love, passion, and solidarity, reflecting the strong emotions and sense of unity within the LGBTQ community. The pink shade (E1BEE7) symbolizes inclusivity, tenderness, and understanding, promoting a welcoming atmosphere for diverse identities. Navy blue (114069) signifies strength and stability, highlighting the resilience and courage of LGBTQ individuals. Light blue (C2DFE8) represents serenity, tranquility, and harmony, underscoring the peaceful coexistence and acceptance of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Lastly, purple (BC5BBC) embodies creativity, pride, and diversity, reflecting the unique and vibrant spectrum of LGBTQ experiences. Together, this color palette embodies the values of the LGBTQ community and visually represents the pride and celebration of their identities within the "SpectrumInd" project.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts

Amatic and Josefin fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Amatic and Josefin are clean fonts used frequently in programming, so they are both attractive and appropriate.

### Imagery

All images used on this project are free copyrights. They are used within the site has been chosen to showcase the LGBTQ+ community. The images are also used to add visual interest to the website and to help break up different sections of the page. Imagery is relevant to the content and mission of the website and is also appropriately sized and optimized for web use to ensure fast page loading times. 

### Wireframes

All of the mock up designs for the web app were created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a popular design tool known for its versatility and collaborative features. During design stage was kept in mind the principles of UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design throughout the process to ensure that designs are intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Additionally, the mock up designs are responsive and optimized for use on tablets and mobile devices, to provide a seamless experience across different screen sizes. Personally, I find it very helpful to create a mockup design rather than a wireframe when I began a project, it helps a lot with styling, colours, layout during development.

### Navbar
On the landing page, users will be presented with a visually appealing and user-friendly navbar positioned at the very top.

### Hero Section
Creating a strong first impression with the user is crucial, and to achieve this, a hero image with 100% screen width and 60% screen height was employed. This hero image acts as an introduction to site, displaying two distinct images accompanied by engaging heading that effectively communicate the purpose and essence of the web app. The design is fully responsive, ensuring seamless adaptation.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.
